# Postgres Data Model

ADR 0010 supersedes the original DynamoDB and GCP-era designs. Hinterland now
uses Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server as the operational store.

The logical product invariants are unchanged:

- first-find detection is atomic
- leaderboard counters live on membership rows
- expedition JSON in git is source of truth
- slow integrations do not block kid-facing submission success
- dispatcher handlers do not call external APIs

| Sanctuary timeline | `select * from sanctuary_events where user_id = $1 order by created_at desc` |

## Atomic Submission Transaction

`POST /v1/observations` must commit the core product state in one transaction:

1. Acquire the per-user PostgreSQL advisory lock.
2. Recheck the operation-scoped idempotency key/request hash and lock the photo
   reservation.
3. Attach the verified canonical photo and insert exactly one observation.
4. Increment the membership observation counter exactly once.
5. Insert one pending handler ledger row per registered handler.
6. Insert the moderation outbox row.
7. Persist the successful create idempotency result.

After that transaction commits, the dispatcher runs under the same per-user
serialization contract and persists handler state/rewards. An infrastructure
or handler failure does not roll back the authoritative observation; it leaves
`dispatch_status=pending|partial` for durable replay.

The first-find check must not become read-then-write. The database unique
constraint is the source of truth under concurrency.

`observations.ecology_tags` stores closed-choice kid selections used by
Expedition steps, such as `{ "life_stage": "flower" }`. Tags are optional,
validated against the approved key/value catalog at `POST /v1/observations`,
and are never free text or runtime-LLM output.

## Observation And Photo Field Contract

`photos.attachment_status` is separate from moderation:

- `reserved`: SAS issued, not attached to an observation;
- `attached`: canonical JPEG verified and linked;
- `deleted`: bytes must not be served.

Verified photo metadata includes canonical object name, byte count, decoded
dimensions, SHA-256, and verification time. One photo may back only one
observation. The photo and observation share a submission ULID unique per user.

`observations.moderation_status` is one of `pending`, `processing`, `clean`,
`quarantine`, `pilot_private`, `rejected`, or `failed`, with a separate
`moderation_source` (`none|noop|azure|adult`) and policy version. Attachment or
Blob arrival never implies a moderation decision.

Child APIs expose a server-derived `child_presentation_status` rather than raw
photo lifecycle state: `clean|pending|processing|pilot_private|adult_review|failed`.
It is `clean` only when both Observation and Photo are clean and no active
revocation exists. Quarantine becomes `adult_review`; any unknown or mismatched
combination maps to the most restrictive metadata-only state. Rejected/deleted
records are absent from child list/detail reads.

Observations record `observed_at`, optional `geohash4`, and
`location_source=device_coarse|manual_coarse|none|legacy_coarsened`. New raw
latitude/longitude is not durable data. Compatibility latitude/longitude input
is converted in memory, never stored or logged.

Identification records a project-catalog taxon ID or manual/Unknown choice,
`identification_source`, and `identification_revision`. When a taxon ID is
present, the server ignores client-supplied names and uses the catalog's
canonical display name. Manual and Unknown observations are Dex-ineligible.

## Maintained Dex Projection

`dex_entries` keeps atomic first-find insertion as its celebration gate and
also stores `observation_count >= 0`, `latest_seen_at` from accepted
observations' `observed_at`, and nullable representative clean
observation/photo references. `first_seen_at` and `first_observation_id` remain
separate from the representative image.

An accepted backdated observation may replace the earliest first-observation
metadata without emitting another first-find reward. Every successful
DexHandler ledger run updates count/latest idempotently; a clean moderation
transition may update the representative to the newest accepted clean photo.
Rejection or identification correction replaces the entire user projection
through the deterministic rebuild. Taxa with zero accepted observations are
removed. Normal Dex reads never scan/aggregate all Observation rows.

Indexes support `(user_id, first_seen_at, id)` on Dex and
`(user_id, observed_at DESC, id DESC)` over non-rejected observations. Field
Journal cursors encode the latter tuple, so equal timestamps are deterministic.

## Handler And Work Ledgers

`observation_handler_runs` is keyed by observation, stable handler name, and
handler version. Rows record dependency-aware status, attempt count, JSON state,
and persisted rewards. `dispatched_at` is set only when every required handler
succeeds; `dispatch_status=partial` means durable recovery remains.

`moderation_outbox` is unique per observation. Only its committed rows may
produce Service Bus messages. Direct BlobCreated/Event Grid moderation is
forbidden.

`derived_state_rebuilds` coalesces per user. Rejection and revision-checked
identification correction enqueue it transactionally. Expedition contribution
gates prevent one observation from advancing the same step twice under replay.

`photo_revocations` is unique by photo and records source, claim-time review
status, requesting adult when present, restricted held destination, expected
SHA-256/length, state, attempt count, last error, and timestamps. Its active
state denies all new URL issuance before storage mutation begins. Its review
foreign key is restrictive so review cleanup cannot erase that deny gate.
Recovery is destination/source idempotent and alerts after bounded retry
exhaustion.

## Additive Migration Procedure

The Observation repair uses new Alembic revisions; applied migrations are not
edited. Deployment must:

1. report duplicate photo, submission, review, and negative-counter keys;
2. keep the earliest observation for a duplicated photo, tombstone later rows,
   and queue affected users for rebuild;
3. backfill compatible legacy submission keys while leaving the columns
   nullable for the old-API migration-first window; the new API always writes
   them and the scheduled cutover reconciler fills any race rows;
4. map observed photos to attached/pending and leave unattached rows reserved;
5. set legacy `observed_at=created_at`;
6. retain only an existing `geohash4`, null precise coordinates, and mark the
   source `legacy_coarsened`;
7. register every attached pending legacy observation in `moderation_outbox`;
8. canonicalize old `pending/<photo_id>.jpg` bytes before the relay can publish
   them, rejecting invalid/missing bytes and queuing a rebuild;
9. mark historical derived state `unverified` and queue rebuilds;
10. validate unique/check constraints only after reconciliation; and
11. retain compatibility columns/status mappings for one mobile release.

## Rejection And Identification Correction

Rejection first claims a durable revocation, immediately denies new photo URL
issuance, copies/verifies the clean object into the held/rejected prefix, and
synchronously removes the clean source. It then tombstones the authoritative
observation and queues a rebuild instead of piecemeal counter decrements. A
revision-checked identification correction uses the same rebuild path.

The rebuild acquires the same user advisory lock and atomically regenerates
membership counters, Dex, Expedition contribution, rarity, Sanctuary, handler
ledger, and stored rewards from accepted observations ordered by
`(observed_at, id)`. Expedition enrollment/start times remain intact. Normal
reads never aggregate observations at request time.

## Expedition Progress

Expedition progress is personal kid game state. `expedition_progress.user_id`
is the dispatch and read scope; `group_id` remains on the row as creation
context for audit/history, not as the active progression boundary. The mobile
quest loop highlights one focused incomplete expedition at a time through
nullable `focused_at`, with a partial unique index enforcing at most one focused
row per user.

## Ingest And Cursors

`ingest_runs` is the operational record for replayable data movement. Content
sync, taxa refresh, rarity snapshots, moderation events, and telemetry-derived
jobs all write run state before mutating durable app data.

Failed ingest runs are replayed by source and cursor. Replays must be
idempotent and must not duplicate observations, Dex rows, expedition rows, or
review queue items.

## Sanctuary State

Sanctuary is per-user derived state -- a materialized view of observation
outcomes, not an authoritative source. Authoritative state lives on
`observations`, `dex_entries`, and `memberships` rows. Sanctuary state is
derived from observation history via `WorldHandler` and the four tables below.

### `sanctuary_zone_state`

Per-user, per-zone observation count and current depth tier. One row per
`(user_id, zone_id)`.

- ULID `id` PK; `user_id` FK to `users.id` (ondelete CASCADE)
- `zone_id` `String(40)` NOT NULL; `observation_count` and `depth_tier` Integer
  NOT NULL (server default 0)
- Bookkeeping pointers `first_unlocked_observation_id` and
  `last_evolved_observation_id` are FK to `observations.id` with
  ondelete=SET NULL so zone state survives observation deletion
- `last_observed_at` DateTime(tz) nullable
- `created_at` + `updated_at` via the standard timestamp mixin
- `UniqueConstraint(user_id, zone_id)` enforces the one-row-per-zone shape
- `Index(user_id, depth_tier)` supports per-user tier sweeps

### `sanctuary_elements`

Per-user record of which named Sanctuary unlocks (zone wake-ups, charismatic
species, relationship moments, surprises, signature finds) have fired.

- ULID `id` PK; `user_id` FK to `users.id` (ondelete CASCADE)
- `zone_id` `String(40)` NOT NULL; `element_id` `String(80)` NOT NULL;
  `element_type` `String(40)` NOT NULL
- `element_type` `CheckConstraint` in `('coarse', 'charismatic',
  'relationship', 'surprise', 'signature')`
- `source_observation_id` FK to `observations.id` ondelete=SET NULL,
  `taxon_id` Integer nullable
- `payload` JSONB NOT NULL default `{}` carries the reward-shape snapshot for
  the celebration sequence
- `unlocked_at` DateTime(tz) NOT NULL; `created_at` + `updated_at` via mixin
- `UniqueConstraint(user_id, zone_id, element_id)` is the atomic-first-fire
  gate. `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` wins exactly one row; this mirrors
  the Dex first-find pattern and satisfies the AGENTS.md invariant that
  first-find detection must be an atomic conditional write
- `Index(user_id, zone_id)` supports per-zone unlock reads

### `sanctuary_observation_contributions`

The structural idempotency gate for `WorldHandler` replay. One row per
observation that has already contributed to Sanctuary state.

- PK is `observation_id` (FK to `observations.id`, ondelete=CASCADE). The
  observation IS the gate, so there is no separate ULID `id` column
- `user_id` FK to `users.id` (ondelete CASCADE)
- `zone_id` `String(40)` NOT NULL; `taxon_id` Integer nullable;
  `iconic_taxon` `String(80)` nullable
- `element_ids` JSONB NOT NULL default `[]` lists the element rows fired by
  this observation
- `created_at` only (no `updated_at`); rows are write-once
- If the dispatcher replays the same observation twice, the second `INSERT`
  raises a primary-key collision on `observation_id`. The WorldHandler treats
  that collision as the signal to skip every counter bump and element fire
  from this observation. This is how Sanctuary survives Phase 8's
  dispatcher-replay scenario without double-counting

### `sanctuary_events`

Append-only audit log of Sanctuary state changes the kid saw. Drives the
on-submit celebration sequence and the journal / timeline screen.

- ULID `id` PK; `user_id` FK to `users.id` (ondelete CASCADE)
- `observation_id` FK to `observations.id` (ondelete=SET NULL so events
  survive observation deletion as audit), nullable
- `event_type` `String(40)` NOT NULL with `CheckConstraint` in
  `('world_unlock', 'world_evolution', 'relationship', 'surprise')`
- `zone_id` and `element_id` nullable; `title` `String(100)` NOT NULL;
  `detail` `String(240)` nullable
- `payload` JSONB NOT NULL default `{}`
- `created_at` only (no `updated_at`); rows are immutable once written
- `Index(user_id, created_at)` supports the timeline read

### Sanctuary preserves leaderboard and privacy invariants

Sanctuary state is **not** on `memberships` rows. Leaderboard counters stay
on `memberships` (per the AGENTS.md invariant: "Leaderboard counters live on
membership rows. Do not aggregate observations at read time for normal
leaderboard reads.") and the Sanctuary tables are completely independent of
the leaderboard path. The `sanctuary_zone_state.observation_count` field is a
per-zone counter scoped by the `(user_id, zone_id)` unique key; it never
participates in any leaderboard read and never replaces the membership-level
counter.

**No precise location is stored in any Sanctuary-specific row.** Zone routing
happens in `WorldHandler` (Phase 2) from the observation's `iconic_taxon` and
the content map; precise lat/lng never lands in `sanctuary_zone_state`,
`sanctuary_elements`, `sanctuary_observation_contributions`, or
`sanctuary_events`. `tests/test_sanctuary_schema.py` enforces this at the
schema level: any column whose name contains `lat`, `lng`, `geo`, `addr`,
`place`, or `coord` on any Sanctuary table fails CI.
